This folder contains the metadata for some example data results. The actually data can be located at:

These were derived for the following manuscript in Remote Sensing of the Environment:


The data are in MATLAB .mat format as Data Tables, and can be opened in MATLAB using the load function

The data tables are in the following structure:

1: FileName - The name if the HDF file

2: Dates - The date of the file (MM/DD/YYYY)

3: Times - Time in UTC (HMMSS)

4: DayNightFlag - Day and Night Flag (local time), with 1 = Day and 0 = Night

5: SceneRMap - Contains the full scene map reference information for each cell

6: SceneInfo - Contains the metadata for the scene from the HDF files

7-11: SceneDN_## - Contains the full scene digital number data for each band (uint16)

12-16: FullScene_## - Contains the full scene data (gain and offset corrected) for each band (double)

17: ImageRmap - Contains the map reference information for each cell in the subset 90 x 90 pixel area around the volcano

18-22: ImageDN_## - Contains the 90 x 90 pixel subset area digital number data for each band (uint16)

23-27: ImageScene_## - Contains the 90 x 90 pixel subset area data (gain and offset corrected) for each band (double)

28: Gabor - The results of the Gabor processing for each image (double)

29: STThreshold - The Gabor threshold used to determine anomalies (double)

30: G_ID - Mask of anomalous pixels determined from Gabor (double)

31: G-Temp - Temperature of anomalous pixels determined from Gabor (double) (Kelvin)

32: InnerAnnulusRadius - The radius in pixels of the annulus calculated determining the extent of the anomalous pixels away from the volcano summit(double). This is used to determine the background temperature calculation.

33: G_TAB - The above background temperature of the anomalous pixels in Kelvin (double)

34: G_Background - The location and temperature of the background area used in the processing

35: AnomalyCategory - The anomaly category determining the anomaly status for each scene, with: 0 = Summit off scene, 1 = Cloudy scene 2 = No anomaly detected 3 = Anomaly detected
